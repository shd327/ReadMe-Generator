## Installation
The README generator requires installation of Node.js. Users must also have access to a IDE such as Visual Studio Code with access to the terminal or access to GitBash/Command Line Interface to run Node. Inquirer npm must also be installed.

## Usage
To use the README generator run: "Node index.js" in the terminal. You will be prompt with a series of questions via the terminal. After the prompts are answered, open the new README.md created in the current working directory, and preview the README (hit CTRL + Shift + V to preview in Visual Studio Code).
